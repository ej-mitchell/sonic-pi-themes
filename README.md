## What is this?

A repository of familiar themes and original works that have been written out in Ruby files. These Ruby files are a good starting place for creating and improvising upon larger Sonic Pi projects. As a note, some of the familiar themes I've done by ear and others I was able to find open source music that gave me the notes/rhythm. If there are issues with how I've done some of the familiar themes, please open up an issue (or a PR with the fix) and I would be happy to review.

## How do you use it?

Say you want to do a remix of a famous _Star Wars_ theme. Say you didn't have the time to write it all out for Sonic Pi yourself. This is just a repo of time-savers and creative departures to make music reference easier. Copy and paste the themes you like into your project, and adjust them at you will.
